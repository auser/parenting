= Parenting

== DESCRIPTION:

Easily add parents to classes

== SYNOPSIS:

Usage:

Subclass parenting::base:

class Quickie < Parenting::Base
end

Then, use to your heart's content! When you instance_eval in a block, your parent will be set with parent. This is handled with a context stack that is globally accessible. You can get the object's current context by calling current_context on an object (at runtime). 

== INSTALL:

sudo gem install auser-parenting
